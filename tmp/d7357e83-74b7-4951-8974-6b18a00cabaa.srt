00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,800
micro services architects

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,350
is a pattern for organizing computers

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,000
into services that can scale with demand

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:21,250
back in the nineteen nineties on internet company would run a big monolithic program on a server that the company maintained on premises

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,850
to serve an increase in traffic a popular company would simply add more instances of the model

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,350
money the architectures do have some positive

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,300
a model centralizes the code based so it is in one place

8
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,500
engineers can step through any part of the cote when they are deep

9
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:48,750
also use requests that are completely served by a model i do not have to make many calls across 

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,050
which reduces the chance of network failures

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,400
most software companies have their code in a monolith 

12
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,150
when those models get big problems can start

13
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,250
centralized code leads to tight couplings that are hard to break up

14
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,550
if a program is too big it will be impossible to run on a typical machine

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,250
internet giants in the early to thousands began breaking up their application

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,600
in

17
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,650
instead of scaling the model with the application a service oriented architect

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,100
could skill the parts of an application that were under low

19
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:31,100
operating system virtual ization made service oriented architecture more economical

20
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,150
one server could host multiple virtual ized operating system

21
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,950
and each of those instances could run a service

22
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,900
but this also meant that engineers had to manage more and more layers of 

23
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,350
the virtual machine host the hyper visor later

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,250
and the hard work

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,150
failures became more complex digging got harder

26
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,250
in two thousand six amazon web services launched the elastic

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,150
yes to allow programmers to rent a virtual machines in amazon's data

28
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,250
with amazon taking care of failures of the hardware level and the hyperion level

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,950
programmers could focus on the virtual machine hosts 

30
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,700
whether application coat was running

31
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,550
but using an entire virtual

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,700
a small piece of application 

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,100
as

35
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,500
containers allow a virtual machine to be sliced up into isolated file system

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,650
a container can be as large as the entire vin or as small as your smallest service

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,600
the term micro

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,600
micro services running contain

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,700
which ran on a virtual machine

40
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,500
which runs on a hay provisor which runs on a server

41
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,000
which sits in a row

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,500
it's in a date set

43
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:07,350
just part of a network of data enters called the cloud container is darker led to a new problem companies that run thousands of micro services in containers on the cloud did not have a simple way of mankind

44
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:15,900
cover nettings is an open source project google that gives engineers centralized system for managing the states

45
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,400
gubernatis also makes those services with portable

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:27,400
creating a competitive tension between amazon web services and google cloud platform both of which can host covered

47
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,250
the days of micro services are just getting 

48
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,950
software development has never been easy

49
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,100
and the two biggest companies in the cloud are competing for

50
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,550
it's going to keep getting easier and
